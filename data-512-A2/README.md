<h1> Assigment A2 : Bias in Data</h1>

<h3>The objective of this analysis to determine whether the Wikipedia Talk corpus contains bias or the characteristics of that bias and highlight its potential consequences</h3>
Data source link - https://figshare.com/projects/Wikipedia_Talk/16731 
For the purpose of this analysis, I have only utilized Aggression Datasets

<h3> EDA included investigating following questions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Is there a bias in dataset from age-group represenatin perspective? And is there a difference between average aggression scores provided by crowdworkers in different age-groups?</li>
<li> Is there a bias in dataset from English language preference perspective? And is there a difference between average aggression scores provided by crowdworkers who have english language as their first language vs who don't? </li>
    </ul>

<h3> Results </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Distribution of age-group in aggression dataset suggests that crowdworker age-group was biased towards young age-group as we see 48% of crowdworkers belonging to age-group '18-30' years. This could potentially introduce bias due to theor view in political, gender, age or sexual orientation</li>
    <li>the distribution of average aggression rating among different age groups , we notice that over 60 age group is more biased towards rating comment as aggressive , whereas age group '18-30' seems pretty balanced in the rating spectrum. </li>
    <li>Distribution of comments rated by crowdworkers according to their first language, we notice that 86% of workers do not have english language as preffered language and since all the comments are english language, their could potentially be a lot bias introduced due to technical aspects of language and various perspective differences</li>
    <li>When combining both age group and forst language, we can clearly observe that first language plays a major role in extreme age buckets 'Under 18' and 'Over 60'. The Mean aggression score for these groups are very different on the basis of their first language</li>
    </ul>
