<h1> Final Project Proposal </h1>

<h3> Problem Statement - </h3> 

I am planning to analyze the Employement Occupation data from year 2013 to year 2018 to analyze how emplyement rate has changed for multiple occupations. Motivation for studying this dataset arise because I haev a hypothesis that technology doesn't kill manual jobs but rather supplement them. It will be great to analyze also specifically washington state data nd specifically Seattle data to understand how Microsoft, Amazon and Google have changed face of 'types of jobs' in the city.
