<h1> Final Project Proposal </h1>

<h3> Problem Statement - </h3> 

I am planning to analyze the Poverty data from year 2013 to year 2018 to analyze how poverty share varies between men and women across different age-group. 


<h3> Data source: </h3> 
https://datausa.io/api/data?Geography=04000US53&drilldowns=Age,Gender&measure=Poverty%20Population,Poverty%20Population%20Moe&Poverty%20Status=0

<h3> Research questions and/or hypotheses </h3>
<h4> Question </h4>
Which gender has highest share of poverty across year 2013 to year 2018 across multiple age - group?

<h4> Hypothesis </h4> 
Older women (age greater than 20 years) have highest share of poverty in the state of washington. 

<h3> Background/Related Work </h3>
11.5% of the population for whom poverty status is determined in Washington (822k out of 7.16M people) live below the poverty line, a number that is lower than the national average of 13.1%. The largest demographic living in poverty are Females 25 - 34, followed by Females 18 - 24 and then Males 18 - 24.

<h3> Methodology </h3> 
Descriptive analysis to identify how share of poverty has trended across years and age-group for male and female.
