<h3> Motivation and problem statement</h3>
The rapid global spread of the virus COVID-19 has provoked a spike in demand for hospital care. Hospital systems across the world have been over-extended, including in Northern Italy, Ecuador, and New York City, and many other systems face similar challenges. As a result, decisions on how to best allocate very limited medical resources have come to the forefront. Specifically, under consideration are decisions on who to test, who to admit into hospitals, who to treat in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who to support with a 
Hence, I would like to explore how COVID-19 severity is related to Patients Medical History procuring patient data of COVID-19 containing specific information regarding patient's history. The dataset was released by the Mexican government which contains a huge number of anonymised patient-related information.
They have been in the dark failing to understand how much resource they could even in the very next week as the COVID-19 curve has swayed very unpredictably. In these tough times, being able to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of great help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient. Hence, I would like to explore how COVID-19 severity is related to Patients Medical History procuring patient data of COVID-19 containing specific information regarding patient's history. The dataset was released by the Mexican government which contains a huge number of anonymised patient-related information.

<h2> <i>Dataset information</i></h2> 
This dataset that has been open for the general public by the Mexican Government (and updated daily). These data include information about every person who has been tested for COVID-19 in Mexico. They include demographic information such as: Age, Location, Nationality, the use of an indigenous language; as well as information on pre-existing conditions, including whether the patient has: diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, other prior diseases, and whether was or is using tobacco

This dataset is appropriate for my analysis as it contains all relevant information related to the problem statement I wish to explore such as - 

<ul>
<li>How did different age group of people get impact by COVID according to their medical history?</li>
<li>How their medical history played a role in severity of COVID?</li>
<li>Is there one particular disease history that is proving to be deadlier or severe than any other?</li>
<li>Can we find a pattern in the data to help us decide on the factors which can later be proven helpful in predicting the cases?</li>
</ul>

<h2> <i>Dataset limitations / Unknowns </i></h2> 
Procuring patient data of COVID-19 patients containing patient-specific information regarding patient history and habits is extremely hard. This is mainly due to the regulatory security laws such as HIPAA and GDPR which makes it almost impossible for anyone to get hands-on PHI data. The dataset was released by the Mexican government which contains a huge number of anonymised patient-related information.



<h4>Ethical considerations of dataset</h4> - As this dataset contains PII information of patients and each individual can easily be identified with their medical history pattern, it is imporatnt to hadle this data with great care and ananimization
