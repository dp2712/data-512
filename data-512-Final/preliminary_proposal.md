<h3> Motivation and problem statement</h3>
As COVID-19 rapid growth thorughout the world has caused huge spike in demand of hospital supplies and care, Hospitals across the world have been struggling greatly with the problem of allocating right resources to the right cases and also forecasting the resources required. It becomes crucial for hospitals to understand every factor that can potentially be utilized in demand forecasting of the resources for COVID patients and be helpful in saving lives. In these circumstances, there could potentially be useful information realted to patient's history and severity of COVID symptoms.  
Hence, I would like to explore how COVID-19 severity is related to Patients Medical History procuring patient data of COVID-19 containing specific information regarding patient's history. The dataset was released by the Mexican government which contains a huge number of anonymised patient-related information on their medical history and their data post admittance in hospital due to COVID-19.


<h2> <i>Dataset information</i></h2> 
This dataset is published by Mexican governement and updated on the daily basis. These data include information about COVID-19 patients in Mexico and includes demographic information such as Age, Gender as well as information on patient's medical history such whether the patient has: diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, other prior diseases, and whether was or is using tobacco. This dataset is published in Spanish language and due to time constraints and lack of Spanish language knowledge, I will be utilizing the dataset that was translated, cleand and published as a Kaggle dataset.

This dataset is appropriate for my analysis as it contains all relevant information related to the problem statement I wish to explore such as - 

<ul>
<li>How did different age group of people get impact by COVID according to their medical history?</li>
<li>How their medical history played a role in severity of COVID?</li>
<li>Is there one particular disease history that is proving to be deadlier or severe than any other?</li>
<li>Can we find a pattern in the data to help us decide on the factors which can later be proven helpful in predicting the cases?</li>
</ul>

<h2> <i>Dataset limitations / Unknowns </i></h2> 
Procuring patient data of COVID-19 patients containing patient-specific information regarding patient history and habits is extremely hard. This is mainly due to the regulatory security laws such as HIPAA and GDPR which makes it almost impossible for anyone to get hands-on PHI data. The dataset was released by the Mexican government which contains a huge number of anonymised patient-related information.



<h4>Ethical considerations of dataset</h4> - As this dataset contains PII information of patients and each individual can easily be identified with their medical history pattern, it is imporatnt to hadle this data with great care and ananimization
