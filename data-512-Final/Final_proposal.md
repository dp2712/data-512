<h3> Motivation and problem statement</h3>
A health crisis of massive proportion such as the current COVID-9 pandemic provides us with an opportunity to ponder and reflect over what we can better in the way we deal with healthcare to make us humans be more prepared and enabled to combat such an event in the future.
During the entire course of the pandemic, one of the main problems that healthcare providers have faced is the shortage of medical resources and a proper plan to efficiently distribute them.
They have been in the dark failing to understand how much resource they could even in the very next week as the COVID-19 curve has swayed very unpredictably. In these tough times, being able to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of great help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient. Hence, I would like to explore how COVID-19 severity is related to Patients Medical History procuring patient data of COVID-19 containing specific information regarding patient's history. The dataset was released by the Mexican government which contains a huge number of anonymised patient-related information.

<h3> Dataset information</h3> 
This dataset contains anonymised patient's ID, gender, date of entry to hospital, date of first symptoms, date of death if applicable, flags on various disease history

<h3> Research questions and hypothsis </h3>

Some of the questions I want to answer from this datset are - 
<ul>
<li> <i><b>Question - </i></b> How did different age group of people get impact by COVID according to their medical history?</li>
  <ul> Hypothesis - </ul>
<li><i><b>Question - </i></b> How their medical history played a role in severity of COVID?</li>
   <ul> Hypothesis - </ul>
<li><i><b>Question - </i></b> Is there one particular disease history that is proving to be deadlier or severe than any other?</li>
   <ul> Hypothesis - </ul>
<li<i><b>Question - </i></b> Can we find a pattern in the data to help us decide on the factors which can later be proven helpful in predicting the cases?</li>
   <ul> Hypothesis - </ul>
</ul>


<h4>Ethical considerations of dataset</h4> - As this dataset contains PII information of patients and each individual can easily be identified with their medical history pattern, it is imporatnt to hadle this data with great care and ananimization
